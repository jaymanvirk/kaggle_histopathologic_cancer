# Histopathologic cancer detection: Exploring architectural variations and hyperparameter impact on CNN

## Abstract
This study briefly investigates the impact of different architectures and hyperparameters on the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) through a comparative analysis of five distinct models. The research focuses on understanding how variations in the model design influence the models' ability to classify pathology images. The dataset utilized in this study comprises a substantial collection of small pathology images, categorized into two classes: images containing metastatic cancer and images devoid of it. By altering model configurations such as network depth, layer sizes, max pooling and dropout layer inclusion, the study explores the models' accuracy, efficiency, and generalization capabilities.
